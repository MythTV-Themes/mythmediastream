This theme is designed to work with a custom menu called MythMediaStreamMenu. To select this menu, go to the 'theme & screensettings' menu in your frontend and set your Menu theme to 'MythMediaStream'.

If you want to use this theme with any of the other menus available in mythtv, please edit the base.xml in the folder MythMediaStream and set the <stretch></stretch> tag in the "mainmenu" fontdefinition to "extracondensed" to make your menu items readable with this theme.
